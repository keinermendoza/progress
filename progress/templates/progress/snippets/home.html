    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-1  text-blue-900 font-semibold">What is this app for?</h2>
    
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        This is a management tool,
        focused on communicating project progress and receiving feedback.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl mb-1  text-blue-900 font-semibold">Use "client mode"</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">To start you need to register. By registering you will be able to
         interact in all projects marked as Public, all users have access to public projects.
         Access to private projects is controlled from the admin (<a class="underline text-sky-600 hover:text-sky-700" href="#test-admin">see test admin access</a>).
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl mb-1  text-blue-900 font-semibold">The feedback</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
        Every user has permission to create notes on projects and tasks that they can see. You can also edit or delete your notes.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl mb-1  text-blue-900 font-semibold">Limitations of "client mode"</h3>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Registration, editing and deletion of Projects and Tasks are only available
         from the admin. a normal user does not have permissions to perform any of these actions.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl mb-1  text-blue-900 font-semibold" id="test-admin">Test admin access</h3>

    <p class="text-lg">As you can see, what I am presenting is basically client mode. 
        but I really invite you to also try it from the perspective of a staff user.
        feel free to fork my repo on github, and test the app locally. Feel free to ask me questions
        through linkedin, facebook, through my site, or through the medium in which you have seen the publication.
    </p>
